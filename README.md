# Build Week Group Project

## Build the HTML/CSS/JS Marketing Page / User Interface for Website

My role in the group was 'User Interface Developer', where my goals were:

Build a multi-page marketing website that matches the theme chosen by my group and provides the user with details about the product our team has selected to build.

Marketing website must include responsive mobile and desktop screen widths.

The call to action on the website should be a login button that links the user over to the React application that our Front End Architect built.

Marketing website must be hosted on a hosting platform like “Netlify” or “Github Pages”.

Marketing site’s home page should have content and copy that relates to the product that our team worked on.

For a second page, create an 'about us' section that includes images of the members of our team, and links to one another’s socials/Github.

Project Description

Pitch: As an expat, I want to be able to show off the places I've been and remember them for myself. I have a lot of amazing pics and stories from around the world I'd like to share, but I need a site that is more professional than Instagram in order to do so.

MVP: User can visit site and see photos laid out in a grid, travelers can create, read, update, and delete stories and photos. (No ability to upload one's own photos for MVP.)

Stretch Goal: Build an image uploader into the site to allow users the ability to upload their own assets. (This will require some work with a package called Drop Zone and a service called cloudinary.)
